            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella</tp:taxon-name></italic> Fleischer is a genus of nine species known so far from India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, Borneo and the Philippines. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Magill (1980)</xref> examined this genus carefully and defined it in detail by shifting the odd members to other genera such as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Myurium</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Pterobryopsis</tp:taxon-name></italic>. The genus is characterised by long stem, creeping on bark, usually dendroid by pinnate or bipinnate branching or long drooping, sometimes with flagelliform branches; leaves ovate-lanceolate, acuminate, concave, with short, single or double costa, leaf cells elongate-smooth. The alar is usually not differentiated, however in some species it is coloured and with porose walls. The capsule is immersed or exserted, with small, cucullate, naked, calyptra. The spores are large and papillose.</p>
            <p>Four taxa, <italic>viz</italic>., <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella borii</tp:taxon-name></italic> Dixon, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella pilifolia</tp:taxon-name></italic> Dixon, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella subulata</tp:taxon-name></italic> Broth. and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella tortifolia</tp:taxon-name></italic> Dixon were reported from the North-eastern India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Gangulee 1972</xref>). Of these <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella borii</tp:taxon-name></italic> Dixon was moved to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Myurium</tp:taxon-name></italic> as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Myurium borii</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Dixon) Magill, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella pilifolia</tp:taxon-name></italic> Dixon to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Pterobryopsis</tp:taxon-name></italic> as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Pterobryopsis pilifolia</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Dixon) Magill. Another related taxon, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodon involutus</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Thwaites &amp; Mitt.) Broth. was transferred to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella</tp:taxon-name></italic> as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella involuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Thwaites &amp; Mitt.) M.Fleischer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Magill 1980</xref>). Thus in India three valid species, <italic>viz</italic>.,<italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella subulata</tp:taxon-name></italic> Broth., <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella tortifolia</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodon involutus</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Thwaites &amp; Mitt.) Broth.,were known to occur. Among these, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella involuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Thwaites &amp; Mitt.) M.Fleischer extends upto Southern India also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Manju et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Daniels 2010</xref>).</p>
            <p>During our recent exploration in the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Shola</tp:taxon-name></italic> forests (Southern montane wet temperate forests) of New Amarambalam Reserve Forest in the Malappuram District of Kerala, we collected an interesting species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella</tp:taxon-name></italic>, which showed distinguishing characteristics from the other known species. We here describe this entity as a new species and provide a table of comparison with the other known species to India as well as a key.</p>

                    <p>It is named in honour of Professor (Dr.) P.V. Madhusoodanan, for his meritorious contribution towards botany, especially on lower groups of plants of Southern India. He retired recently from the Department of Botany of University of Calicut, and now continues his research as an Emeritus Scientist in the Malabar Botanical Garden (MBG), Kozhikode. It is he who inspired the present authors to undertake studies on the bryophytes and pteridophytes.</p>

            <title>Discussion</title>
            <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella madhusoodananii</tp:taxon-name></italic> is similar to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella tortifolia</tp:taxon-name></italic> in its long acuminate, complanate plicate leaves and some leaves being tortuose at tip. It differs from <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella tortifolia</tp:taxon-name></italic> in its oblong-lanceolate leaves, two distinct, short costa in both main and secondary branch leaves and the leaves on main shoot and secondary branches being similar. In <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella tortifolia</tp:taxon-name></italic> the costa in the secondary branch leaf is single, reaching a little more than half the length. The secondary branches are dendroid by bi-pinnate branching with branching in different planes in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella tortifolia</tp:taxon-name></italic>, and lacks flagelliform branches. However, in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella madhusoodananii</tp:taxon-name></italic> the primary branches are long drooping, secondary branches short and flagelliform branches are frequent.</p>
            <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella madhusoodananii</tp:taxon-name></italic> also shows some similarity with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella subulata</tp:taxon-name></italic> Broth. in its two short costa and ovate-lanceolate leaves. However, in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella madhusoodananii</tp:taxon-name></italic> the cells are highly porose in its lateral wall and in the middle layer the pores are rounded. It is also having hanging secondary branches and copiously flagellate. The costa and cells at stem attachment is yellowish brown, alar cells not prominently differentiated but with deep brown, rectangular porose cells and the leaf insertion is U-shaped. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Gangulee (1972)</xref> commented that the Indian population of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella subulata</tp:taxon-name></italic> Broth. scarcely shows any flagellate branch. However, such branches are reported from the Philippine populations, but with having single costa. The present species is characterised by the leaves being oblong-lanceolate, and with very short and double costa (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). A key to the Indian species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Symphysodontella</tp:taxon-name></italic> is also given for easy identification.</p>

            <p><bold>Conservation status.</bold> The species was found growing on the trees of shola forests (Southern montane wet temperate forests) of New Amarambalam of Kerala, and the adjoining areas of Mukuruty National Park of Tamil Nadu. Located in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, the New Amarambalam Reserved Forests with an area of more than 260 km<sup>2</sup>, is one of the most notable areas in the Western Ghats of Northern Kerala for its unique assemblage of floristic elements. The rare blending of many interesting floral elements makes this area as one among the most potential area to be considered for long term conservation. The unique geographic location and the rugged terrain with folds of hills and deep valleys, as a natural westward extension of the Nilgiri hills make<!--PageBreak--> this landscape dotted with all major vegetation types of Southern India in a short span itself. The proposed plan for designating the New Amarambalam forests of Kerala as a Wildlife Sanctuary has not been materialised yet. The area with its unique geographical location, which changes along a sharp altitudinal gradient and thus offering a good array of natural habitats, forming the rare blend of species assemblages, is no doubt, an ideal landscape to be conserved. This also ensures the long term protection of many species and their populations, in a unique landscape with the continuum of the Nilgiri hills to the Silent Valley and adjacent areas. At present the species is known only from a small area, and with the majority lies in the non-protected part. Its conservation status could be improved by bringing these areas of Kerala state under protection.</p>
