It differs from both <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha paniculata</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha hirsuta</tp:taxon-name></italic>, the two other species, by its leaf pubescence, fewer, more widely spaced and usually patent spathes, deeply ridged seeds with numerous knobby, transversely interrupted ridges, and morning anthesis. It occurs throughout the Congolian forests from Cameroon to Uganda, but it is also disjunct in Ivory Coast, across the Dahomey gap.</p>

            <p>The African endemic genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<tp:taxon-name>Commelinaceae</tp:taxon-name>) has generally been considered to consist of two species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Morton 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Brenan 1968</xref>). It was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Bentham (1849)</xref> for a single West African species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha paniculata</tp:taxon-name></italic> Benth. In his monograph of the family, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Clarke (1881)</xref> also recognized <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha paniculata</tp:taxon-name></italic> var. <italic>glaucescens</italic> C. B. Clarke, which he subsequently abandoned in the Flora of Tropical Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Clarke 1901</xref>). Clarke’s variety was raised to species rank as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha glaucescens</tp:taxon-name></italic> (C. B. Clarke) Hutch. in the first edition of the Flora of West Tropical Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Hutchinson 1936</xref>) but the name was abandoned by Morton in his survey of <tp:taxon-name>Commelinaceae</tp:taxon-name> of West Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Morton 1967</xref>) and treated <!--PageBreak-->in synonymy under <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha paniculata</tp:taxon-name></italic> in the second edition of the Flora of West Tropical Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Brenan 1968</xref>). The second currently recognized species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha hirsuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> Mildbr., was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Mildbraed (1925)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Faden (1998)</xref> recorded <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> as having three species, but the third species had not been described.</p>
            <p>When I first began working on the <tp:taxon-name>Commelinaceae</tp:taxon-name> of Cameroon and examined the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> specimens at the Herbier National du Cameroun (YA) in Yaoundé, Cameroon in 1986, it appeared that there were three distinct species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha</tp:taxon-name></italic>, not the usually accepted two. I came to the same conclusion from studies at the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris (P) the following year. Later studies at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew (K), in connection with work on the Flora of Tropical East Africa, confirmed that the same three species also occurred in Uganda, some 2000 km away. Studies of collections from other herbaria, particularly the National Botanic Garden of Belgium, Brussels (BR), confirmed that the three species also were present in the intervening territory. It was particularly significant that this species was also found to occur in Ivory Coast, almost 1900 km from the nearest locality in Cameroon.</p>

        <sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
            <p>More than 540 herbarium specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> were studied from the following institutions: all the collections from BM, BR, EA, K, NY, MO, US, WAG and YA, and some of the collections from P. Living material of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<italic>Poulsen 1275</italic>, originally from Uganda, and <italic>Faden et al. 86/2</italic>, originally from Cameroon) was cultivated at the Smithsonian Institution Botany Research Greenhouse, in Suitland, Maryland, USA and provided data on flowering times, root tips for chromosome counts, seed collections and liquid preserved flowers. A mitotic chromosome count was obtained using the techniques of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Faden and Suda (1980)</xref>. The seeds were photographed using an Olympus SZX-12MDU dissecting microscope, equipped with an Olympus Q-Color 5 camera, using Image-Pro and extended depth of field (EDF). The distribution map was created using ArcGIS once latitudes and longitudes were determined or estimated for the collections seen.</p>

                    <p> A total of 24 flowering collections of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> have been seen, with specimens collected from all months except April and May. Anthesis occurs in the morning, based on the following records. <italic>Poulsen 1275</italic> from Uganda, cultivated at the Smithsonian Institution Botany Research Greenhouse in 1997, had flowers open by 9:30 a.m. and fading at noon. Two collections from Cameroon, <italic>Hall &amp; Kahn 075/93</italic> and <italic>Keating 90–13</italic> (both US), record this species as flowering in the morning and fading about noon.</p>
                    <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> is easily recognizable but also readily overlooked, judging by its wide distribution and modest number of collections. It is distinctive because of its small stature, leaves with long, uniseriate hairs only on the adaxial surface, small inflorescences with small, well-spaced, often patent (i.e. not becoming deflexed) spathes whose surface is composed entirely or partly of lustrous, brown, bead-like cells, and seeds with numerous, radiating, knobby ridges that are transversely interrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1: 7, 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Plate 1: 3, 4</xref>).</p>

            <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> [etymology: many spathes, few spathes] differs from <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha paniculata</tp:taxon-name></italic> by the consistent presence of long, uniseriate hairs on the adaxial leaf surface (vs. none), which is never scabrous (vs. often scabrous) and by the usually fewer, smaller<!--PageBreak-->, blunter, more widely spaced and less deflexed spathes. It differs from <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha hirsuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> by the usually sparser and shorter uniseriate hairs on the adaxial leaf surface, the absence of such hairs from the abaxial leaf surface and usually the internodes and sheaths (except for the sheath summit), and the inflorescence consisting of fewer, less congested spathes with shorter marginal hairs and with lustrous, brown, bead-like cells on the entire spathe surface or mainly near the midrib (vs. such cells completely lacking). The new species differs from both other species by its generally smaller stature (but see below) and seeds with numerous, knobby, transversely interrupted ridges as compared with generally fewer, smoother, uninterrupted ridges in the seeds of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha paniculata</tp:taxon-name></italic> and testa shallowly ridged-reticulate in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha hirsuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1: 7, 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Plate 1</xref>).</p>
            <p>Leaf pubescence in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha hirsuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> can be quite variable, but plants with sparse pubescence or with long hairs confined to the adaxial leaf surface are restricted to Nigeria and further west, overlapping with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> only in Ivory Coast. Thus throughout nearly all of the range of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic>, the pubescence differences of the leaf lamina, sheath, and internodes between <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha hirsuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> are consistent. The often much less pubescent plants of West African <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha hirsuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> still exhibit the stature, leaf shape and spathes that are typical of the species, so they would not be readily confused with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> even if the two species were more broadly sympatric.</p>
            <p>The new species has been confused in the past with small specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha paniculata</tp:taxon-name></italic> which can be of similar stature and appearance. Some may even have very similar looking spathes and smaller capsules and seeds than in typical plants of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha paniculata</tp:taxon-name></italic>. Such plants can be separated from <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> by the absence of long, uniseriate hairs from the leaves, the spathes generally more crowded, overlapping and deflexed against the inflorescence axis, and the seeds with generally fewer, smooth, uninterrupted ridges, as in typical <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha paniculata</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Plate 1–1).</p>
            <p>This species has been overlooked or misinterpreted partly because of Clarke’s <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha paniculata</tp:taxon-name></italic> var. <italic>glaucescens</italic>, which was raised to a species in the first edition of Flora of West Tropical Africa (FWTA) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Hutchinson (1936)</xref>, although it had already been abandoned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Clarke (1901)</xref> in Floral of Tropical Africa. From a study of the type of this variety, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Brenan (1968)</xref> in the second edtion of FWTA correctly concluded that it was no more than a depauperate form of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha paniculata</tp:taxon-name></italic>, agreeing with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Morton (1967)</xref>. This led Brenan to annotate the only specimen at Kew of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> from West Tropical Africa, <italic>Aké Assi 5707</italic> from Ivory Coast, as “small form--I do not consider <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha glaucescens</tp:taxon-name></italic>...as distinct.” On the other hand, it is clear that Brenan had begun to suspect that there was more variation in the genus than the two West African species by his note on the species folder of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha paniculata</tp:taxon-name></italic> from Uganda, which included specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic>: “Some of these Uganda sheets look distinct and should be investigated.”</p>
            <p>The collection <italic>Letouzey 11465</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, arrow) from Cameroon is accepted as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> with reservation. The pubescence of the upper leaf surface is more like that of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha hirsuta</tp:taxon-name></italic>, with the uniseriate hairs longer, denser and paler than in typical <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic>. However the absence of uniseriate hairs from the lower leaf surface, sheaths (except for the summits) and internodes distinguishes it from all Cameroonian specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha hirsuta</tp:taxon-name></italic>. Moreover, the outer surface of the small spathes is composed <!--PageBreak-->solely of lustrous, dark brown, bead-like cells, which are present in all specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> but none of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha hirsuta</tp:taxon-name></italic>. The short marginal hairs on the spathes also agree with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic>, but are unusual for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha hirsuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> in the same region. Overall, <italic>Letouzey 11465</italic> is best treated as an atypical specimen of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic>.</p>
            <p>Three sheets of <italic>Letouzey 11465</italic> have been seen but those at P and YA were not critically examined. Thus my observations and conclusions have been based solely on the duplicate of this collection from BR. Unfortunately, it lacks seeds, which would be diagnostic.</p>
            <p><italic>Manning 2166</italic> is unusual for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> in several characters. The internodes and surface of the leaf sheaths bear numerous uniseriate hairs, a pubescence that has not been noted in any other collection of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic>. The spathes are also more pubescent than usual, bearing many, long, uniseriate hairs on the surface as well as along the midrib. The longest marginal hairs are &gt;1.5 mm long, the normal maximum for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic>. Moreover, the spathes have very few lustrous, brown, bead-like cells and these are confined to the midrib area towards the spathe bases. In all these characters <italic>Manning 2166</italic> resembles <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha hirsuta</tp:taxon-name></italic>. It differs from that species by its shorter stature, absence of long hairs from the abaxial leaf surface--they are typically present in Cameroonian collections--shorter uniseriate hairs on the internodes and sheath surfaces, and more spaced, patent and pointed spathes that bear at least a small number lustrous, brown, bead-like cells along the midrib. <italic>Manning 2166</italic> might possibly represent a hybrid of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha hirsuta</tp:taxon-name></italic>, but in view of the different times of anthesis in these species, I think it is best considered an atypical specimen of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic>. As in the case of <italic>Letouzey 11465</italic>, only the WAG sheet of <italic>Manning 2166</italic>, of the three specimens seen, was studied in great detail, thus reinterpretation might be necessary when the other sheets can be reexamined.</p>
            <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> has sometimes been collected as part of mixed collections with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha paniculata</tp:taxon-name></italic>. I have seen five such mixed collections: <italic>Lieberberg 922</italic> &amp; 922A(K) from Uganda, <italic>Seret 70</italic> (BR) from the Democratic Republic of Congo, <italic>Schlechter 12714</italic> (BR, K) from the Republic of Congo, and <italic>Letouzey 8742</italic> from Cameroon. Possibly when further duplicates of already seen collections are examined in additional institutions, other mixed collections will be discovered. Thus far no mixed collections have been seen of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha hirsuta</tp:taxon-name></italic>.</p>
            <p>The disjunct occurrence of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> in Ivory Coast is probably not an artifact of under-collection because in both Ghana and Nigeria, the two larger of the four countries between Ivory Coast and Cameroon, there were collectors who took a great interest in <tp:taxon-name>Commelinaceae</tp:taxon-name>. J. K. Morton made numerous collections of <tp:taxon-name>Commelinaceae</tp:taxon-name> in Ghana and elsewhere and wrote several important papers on the family. D. P. Stanfield was an avid collector of <tp:taxon-name>Commelinaceae</tp:taxon-name> in Nigeria and was rewarded for his efforts and lengthy and detailed notes by having a new genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Stanfieldiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> named for him by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Brenan (1960)</xref>. Thus although <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> is somewhat inconspicuous I would have expected it to have been collected in Ghana and/or Nigeria if it occurred there.<!--PageBreak--></p>
            <p>Another factor that makes this disjunct distribution interesting is that it places <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> on both sides of the Dahomey gap, the natural break in the rainforest that separates the Upper Guinean and Congolian forest blocs. A similar distribution pattern is shown by another <tp:taxon-name>Commelinaceae</tp:taxon-name> species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Palisota ambigua</tp:taxon-name></italic> (P.Beauv.) C.B.Clarke, which Flora of West Tropical Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Brenan 1968</xref>) places in southern Nigeria but no further west. However, I observed four collections of this species from Ivory Coast at P in 1987, including <italic>Jolly 39</italic>, so it too spans the Dahomey gap. The question remains whether these Ivory Coast occurrences are relicts of a former, continuous distribution or represent more recent long-distance dispersal events. The berry fruits of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Palisota</tp:taxon-name></italic> would obviously suggest the latter, but because <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> seeds have no obvious means of dispersal—either short distance or long distance—it is more difficult to use the same argument for that disjunction.</p>
            <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> appears to be reproductively isolated from the other two species because of its morning anthesis and flowers fading about noon. In Flora of West Tropical Africa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Brenan (1968)</xref> records the flowering times of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha paniculata</tp:taxon-name></italic> as 2:30–5:00 pm and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha hirsuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> as 2:30 until evening. Thus anthesis for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Polyspatha oligospatha</tp:taxon-name></italic> does not overlap with those of the other two species.</p>
